# üîí NETWORK SECURITY TODO - Implement Safer Options Later

## Current Status: OPTION A (Full Internet Access)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Security Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM (All containers can access external internet)
- **Use Case**: Development and testing

## üö® TODO: Implement Safer Network Options for Production

### OPTION B: Selective Network Access (Recommended for Production)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
networks:
  internal:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true    # Internal services only
  
  external:
    driver: bridge
    internal: false   # Only for services that need API access
  
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: false   # Public facing

services:
  # Only data consumers get external access
  helius_rpc_price_consumer:
    networks:
      - internal
      - external
  
  real_market_data_consumer:
    networks:
      - internal  
      - external
  
  # Other services stay internal
  paper_trading_engine:
    networks:
      - internal  # No external access needed
  
  autonomous_allocator:
    networks:
      - internal  # No external access needed
```

### OPTION C: API Gateway Pattern (Most Secure)

```yaml
# FUTURE: Create dedicated API gateway service
api_gateway:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: gateway/Dockerfile
  networks:
    - external    # Only gateway has internet access
    - internal    # Serves other containers
  environment:
    - ALLOWED_DOMAINS=api.coinbase.com,hermes.pyth.network,public-api.birdeye.so
```

## üìã Implementation Checklist for Later

### Phase 1: Selective Access (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Create separate `external` network  
- [ ] Move data consumers to dual networks
- [ ] Test that trading engine still works without external access
- [ ] Verify API calls still function through selective access

### Phase 2: API Gateway (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Build dedicated API gateway container
- [ ] Implement domain whitelisting
- [ ] Add rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Migrate all external API calls through gateway

### Phase 3: Advanced Security (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Implement API key rotation
- [ ] Add request/response logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring for external API usage
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for API failures

## üîç Security Assessment

### Current Risks (Option A):
- All containers can make arbitrary external requests
- No monitoring of external API usage
- Potential for data exfiltration if container compromised

### Mitigation Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Test current implementation thoroughly
- **Week 2**: Implement Option B (selective access)
- **Month 1**: Consider Option C if needed

## üìä Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check which containers are making external requests
docker compose logs | grep -E "(hermes\.pyth|coinbase|birdeye)"

# Monitor network traffic (if needed)
docker compose exec <service> netstat -tuln

# Test external connectivity
docker compose exec real_market_data_consumer ping -c 3 api.coinbase.com
```
